## Train of Thought

So you start with the frontend, naturally, but the big idea is being delivered images from the backend as sort of a core competency of this whole operation so it feels silly to even mess with serving up images from the assets folder on just the frontend. So I toss on some starter modules of Header, Footer and Comic with basic components to start. Homepage is the LatestComicComponent and everything is squeezed between the Header and Footer. Right now it's just text but how it looks isn't important just yet.
